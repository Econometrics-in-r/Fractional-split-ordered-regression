# Fractional Split Ordered Models
R codes for  fractional split random parameters ordered regression

This code has been produced as a part of my doctoral research. Please cite the following article if you use this code in any kind:

Afghari, A.P., Haque, M.M. and Washington, S., 2018. Applying fractional split model to examine the effects of roadway geometric and traffic characteristics on speeding behavior. Traffic injury prevention, 19(8), pp.860-866.

This R code corresponds with the two most common Fractional Split Random Parameters Ordered regression models: Fractional Split Random Parameters Logit and Fractional Split Random Parameters Probit models. Although this code has been written for crash count data, it may be used for any dependent variable that is of fraction nature.

Prior to running the code, make sure to have "maxLik" and "randtoolbox" packages installed.
